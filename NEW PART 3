    Read a Protein Data Bank (PDB) file and count the frequencies of each atom type.

    This function reads the specified PDB file and counts the occurrences of each unique atom type.
    The PDB file format typically contains records for each atom in a molecular structure. Each record
    starts with the keyword 'ATOM' followed by information about the atom, including its element symbol.
    This function extracts the element symbol from each 'ATOM' record and tallies the frequency of each
    atom type.

    Args:
    file_name (str): The path to the PDB file.

    Returns:
    None: The function prints the atom frequencies to the console.
